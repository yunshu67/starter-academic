  * Course Background

    With the development of imaging technology, our ability to extract information from a microscopic perspective is getting stronger and stronger, and this information is playing an increasingly important role in basic biomedical research and more and more clinical applications. Biomedical imaging technology uses X-rays (CT scan), sound (ultrasound), magnetism (MRI), radiopharmaceuticals (nuclear medicine: SPECT, PET) or light (endoscope, OCT) to assess the current condition of organs or tissues, It can also monitor patients continuously, which is of great significance for subsequent diagnosis and treatment evaluation. In this context, we need to use automatic image analysis methods to extract quantitative information from these huge and complex data sets, reduce clinical workload and improve the accuracy of diagnosis. For example, such algorithms can be used to count the number of cells in a given histological section. In more advanced applications, there are many algorithms that can help doctors evaluate and diagnose certain diseases, such as melanoma, breast lumps and so on.
  * Course Content

    This course will introduce the application of computer vision and machine learning in medical images. A set of specific applications of these methods will be used in real data sets. The course will cover biological imaging and computational pathology to provide brief background knowledge, and extract features through traditional machine learning and neural network deep learning methods to segment, track, and further classify images. The course covers topics: machine learning, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, computer vision, image processing.
